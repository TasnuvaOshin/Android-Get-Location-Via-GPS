# Android-Get-Location-Via-GPS
Without Internet You can get Location Information Via GPS 

public void groupURLSent() {


            Log.d("lac", lac); //this is the main value via this we can get the location .
            Log.d("mcc", mcc);
            Log.d("cellid", cellid);
            Log.d("mnc", mnc);
            //https://cellphonetrackers.org/gsm/gsm-tracker.php go there and past the value and get your location


        }



Here the Local Area Code  is LAC Which is Most Important Part and Cell Id is The Another Important Part
